Conclusion:

Docker does not use any init system. Therefor the only process start is the one described in entrypoint. 
We thought this would work since Grafana uses a services inside docker, but this is only a workaround. 
It does not use system.d at all. We will introduce health checks instead of services which guarantuee
that the necessary processes are running. 


Testing Notes: 

systemctl start node-exporter
->      System has not been booted with systemd as iniit system (PID 1). Can not operate.


service node-exporter start
->      Unrecognized service.
